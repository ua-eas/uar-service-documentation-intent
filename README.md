# uar-service-documentation-intent

This repository contains the Mylyn Intent project that provides
contextual and explanatory notes for the accompanying
"uar-service-documentation" repository.  It's really only useful if
you're using the Eclipse IDE software, and have the Mylyn Intent
plugin installed.  At that point, you have an environment where you
can create contextualizing documentation that "wraps" the documents
from the other repository, generate HTML output combining the two, and
do some other interesting similar tasks.

If you want to learn about why this sort of thing makes any kind of
difference, try starting with the following:

[The Literate Programming Website](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)  
Start at the top of the home page, and read down as far as you are
willing to go.

[Mylyn Intent Wiki](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Intent)  
Just read the "Presentation" section near the top.

[Leo and Literate Programming](http://zoomquiet.org/obp/leo_doc_zh/doc/html/_build/html/design.html)  
Tangentially-related; Leo was how I originally came to literate
programming, and it's got about ten years head-start on Mylyn Intent.
So read as much of this page as feels right, and realize that this is
where Intent could wind up a few years down the road.

[Literate Programming Page at the C2 Wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LiterateProgramming)  
Here's how you can kill a couple of lunch hours link-jumping and
watching a bunch of people arguing about what everything means.  But
seriously: a good way to stretch beyond simple introductory
definitions and start thinking about why (and if) it really matters.

And as always, if you want to know more and don't mind soapboxing,
talk to Mike.
